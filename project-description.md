# Online Sketch

A simple online sketch board.

## description

A sketchboard, kind of a whiteboard where I can draw rectangles, circles, lines, arrows and insert text. 
The sketch will have also Undo/Redo capabilities.
For simplicity all the text will be at the same size, font and color.


## the website

The website has a dark top bar, a simple toolbar at the left top corner, in which I can choose a shape that I want to draw. The shape can also be chosen with keyboard numbers.

1 for rectangle
2 for arrow,
3 for text
4 for line,
5 for circle

The main area has very light grey background color and the shapes are drawn with a dark grey color. 
All the shapes are created by pressing and holding LMB, when it's moved the shape is resized/drawn, and when LMB is released the shape persists on the screen.

## Technology

- Initiate the project with node/npm.
- The project is created with ReactJS with the most common and modern methodologies, tools and patterns.
- Initiate the current folder with GIT. Add the relevant ".gitignore" file.
