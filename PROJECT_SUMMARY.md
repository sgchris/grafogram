# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 🎨 How to Use

1. **Select a Tool**: Click toolbar buttons or use keyboard numbers (1-5)
2. **Draw Shapes**: Click and drag on canvas to create shapes
3. **Add Text**: Select text tool (5), click canvas, type text, press Enter
4. **Undo/Redo**: Use buttons or Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y
5. **Clear Canvas**: Click clear button to remove all shapes

## 🔧 Technical Features

### Storage Client Library
- Abstract interface for future server integration
- LocalStorage implementation for client-side persistence
- Automatic sketch saving and loading

### Drawing Engine
- Optimized canvas rendering
- Support for all shape types with proper styling
- Smooth drawing with real-time preview

### State Management
- React hooks for component state
- History management for undo/redo
- Tool selection with keyboard shortcuts

## 🌟 Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety and IntelliSense support

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with services and utilities
- **Documentation**: Inline comments and JSDoc documentation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for storage operations

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

The application is designed for easy extension:

1. **Server Integration**: Storage client can be easily switched to API calls
2. **Advanced Features**: Multiple colors, line weights, layers
3. **Collaboration**: Real-time multi-user editing
4. **Export/Import**: Save as images or custom file formats
5. **Mobile Support**: Touch gesture support for mobile devices

## 📝 Notes
